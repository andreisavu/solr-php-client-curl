Solr PHP Client using CURL
--------------------------

This is a fork from an older version of the solr php client designed
and implemented by Donovan Jimenez. 

You can find the original code on the Solr issue tracker:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-341

The project is now hosted on Google Code:
http://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client/

Why this fork?
--------------

I have changed the original code to use the phps solr output writer and
curl for doing the requests. I don't have enough time to send a patch 
for the latest version of solr php client. 

Why use curl?
-------------

I need high performance and it seems that curl is a bit faster than 
file_get_contents. You can see a simple benchmark bellow:
